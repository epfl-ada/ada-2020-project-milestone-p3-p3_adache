# Title 

## Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, datasets used. What's the motivation behind your project? How do you propose to extend the analysis from the paper? What story would you like to tell, and why? 

In this project, we want the show the difference when making predictions with and without the use of Google Trends in the model. 
Although the paper explains the advantage of using Google Trends and introduce its readers to its subtilities, it still uses a baseline model to illustrate its point. First, we would like to look at other prediction models in order to choose the optimal one to make our predictions. Second, our model will by applioed to a different set of data. We want to take a chance at predicting the financial stock analysis. 

## Research question
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

- Which Google Trends key-words should we use in our model
- Which models should we explore?

## Proposed dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you've read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible given the datasets at hand.
